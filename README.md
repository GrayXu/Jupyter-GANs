# Jupyter-GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Tensorflow (mainly Keras) implements of GANs with Jupyter Notebook.

## Intro

Use simple **Keras** codes to help you get insights behind different GANs. The whole process would show on **Jupyter Notebooks**, which means that you don't have to actually run those codes to get output results or network architectures.   
**My env: tensorflow-gpu 2.0.0a0**

## List

- DCGAN (*64\*5\*5 conv->128\*5\*5conv*)
