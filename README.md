# Jupyter-GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Tensorflow (mainly Keras) implements of GANs with Jupyter Notebook

## Intro

Use simple **Keras** codes to help you get insights behind different GANs. The whole process would show on **Jupyter Notebooks**, which means that you don't have to actually run those codes to get output results or network architectures.
